### Hi, there, I'm Dima!

---

At the moment I am studying the program Frontend Developer on the Hexlet platform and studying additional materials.
Previously had experience with C/C++ at university.

I am open to new knowledge and skills and striving for further professional development in the chosen direction.
I would be happy to have the opportunity to work in the team implement the acquired skills and realize my contribution to the development of products and business.
